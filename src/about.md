## Where did the name come from?

"Atora" came from mangling "Atlas" until it sounded like something neat. Atlas came from Portal 2.

I changed from Atlas because it was taken as a username literally everywhere all the time. "Suunva" means nothing and is just something I came up with in the shower that sounds neat. There is no deeper meaning.

## How do you pronounce it?

Atora -> Ah-toh-rah

Suunva -> Soon-vah

## Can you do X for me for money?

Probably not, unless you've got a very compelling offer. I'm not really a freelance person (as of now anyway).

## Can you do X for me for free?

no

## Are you Turkish?

No, why do people keep asking me this?
