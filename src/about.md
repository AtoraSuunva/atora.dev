## Where did the name come from?

"Atora" came from mangling "Atlas" until it sounded like something neat. Atlas came from Portal 2.

I changed from Atlas because it was taken as a username literally everywhere all the time. "Suunva" means nothing and is just something I came up with in the shower that sounds neat. There is no deeper meaning.

## How do you pronounce it?

Atora -> Ah-toh-rah

Suunva -> Soon-vah

## What languages do you know?

A bunch: Typescript, Javascript, Rust, Python, Java, C#, PHP, SQL are all ones I'm pretty good at. I have some experience in C++, Basic, Ruby, Lisp, Prolog, and others, but nothing fully committed.

## What languages do you use?

Node.js + Typescript (or Javascript). Rust. Python if I have to work with Python devs. Java and PHP when school assignments forced me to. SQL for database stuff, when Prisma isn't enough, or I can't use Prisma. Docker probably counts.

## What's the site built in?

I built it using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and it's deployed on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). It's a whole combination of templates and markdown and plugins that renders to a static site, it's pretty neat. You can check the source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/atorasuunva/atora.dev) or click the links in the footer on any page to jump right to that page's source

## Can you do X for me?

If it's a feature request/bug report/help request for one of my projects, open up a GitHub issue on the respective repo or send me the request directly. I may or may not respond depending on how busy I am, but I'll try.

If you're asking me to do work for you that isn't related to any of my projects, pay me.
