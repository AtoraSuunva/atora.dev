Some of the bots I've made for Discord, usually for utility or moderation. There's even more I've written for personal things (34k scam sites logged ðŸ˜”)

<Card
  title="Sleetcord"
  description="Not a bot, but a bot framework built on Discord.js. Used in all my bots, it handles interaction/event registering, routing, and handling, massively simplifying building modular bots. Publicly available, but is mainly meant for personal use."
